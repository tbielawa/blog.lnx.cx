# Oh, hi there!

This is the homepage of Tim Bielawa. I'm just another geek from the GeoCities
and Homestead era. Back then before "blogging" we called it `e/n`, or
everything/nothing. This place used to run on WordPress, but I'm over all that
extra work now.

I'm a philosophical naturalist. Think "atheist", except instead of defining my
belief structure by the absence of any theistic system, I define it by the
abundantly observable natural world around us.

He said it pretty well.

If you think I'm cool, you should check out [my cat](/carl/), he's a superstar.
