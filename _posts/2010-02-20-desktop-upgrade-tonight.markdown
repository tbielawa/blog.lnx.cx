Tonight I'm upgrading my desktop ("fridge") from Fedora 11 to 12. For my own personal benefit I'll be documenting the process. Things I want to take note of in particular include: which additional files must be backed up for system services like samba, my current partition map, and what process I used to perform the upgrade (optical media, netboot?).
