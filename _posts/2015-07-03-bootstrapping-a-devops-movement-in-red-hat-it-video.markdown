Back in late 2013 I joined what was jokingly referred to as the Red Hat IT "DevOps" team. We didn't like that name, so we changed it and there-after became officially known as **Team**_** Inception**. _From the time the team was formed, we all accepted that the team was to retire in 18-24 months. We were totally cool with that too! To us having a pure "DevOps" team in perpetuity just didn't make sense.

Over the course of the team's lifespan I feel like I experienced incredible growth, both personally and professionally. I'm proud to look back at all the cool things we accomplished as a **team**, and I'm even more thankful to have had the opportunity to be a member of that team. Here's a _taste_ of some things we did as a team publicly:



	
  * Blogged a [bunch of posts](http://developerblog.redhat.com/tag/inception/) for [Red Hat Developer Blog](http://developerblog.redhat.com/)

	
  * Created a functioning Continuous Deployment system, [Release Engine](https://github.com/rhinception?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=re-) [[Docs](http://release-engine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)]

	
  * Created **[jsonstats](https://github.com/RHInception/jsonstats)**, a tool for exporting system information over a REST interface

	
  * And another tool, [Talook](https://github.com/RHInception/talook), which provides a view into jsonstats running on a collection of servers

	
  * [Cacophony](https://github.com/RHInception/cacophony), a simple REST API for automatic SSL certificate generation

	
  * The [Ansible XML](https://github.com/cmprescott/ansible-xml) module. This grew in popularity so much that we realized the best way to ensure it lives on was by transferring complete ownership over to [Chris Prescott](https://github.com/cmprescott), a former contributor (Thanks Chris)!

	
  * [git-branch-blacklist](https://github.com/RHInception/git-branch-blacklist) - A git-hook based system for blacklisting pushes to specific branches


Two week ago (2015-06-20 → 2015-06-24) the [DevNation](http://www.devnation.org/) and [Red Hat Summit](http://www.redhat.com/summit/) 2015 conferences were held in Boston, MA. Of the many excellent speakers and panel groups [[S](http://www.redhat.com/summit/speakers/session/)|[D](http://www.devnation.org/#agenda)] that held sessions during the conferences, there's one group I am especially fond of: My old team, _Inception_.

On Wednesday, July 24th we held a panel session called _[Bootstrapping a DevOps Movement in Red Hat IT](http://www.redhat.com/summit/agenda/sessions/#12025)_. This was our final activity together as **Team _Inception_**. During this panel-style session [Jen Krieger](https://about.me/jen_krieger), our Product Owner/Scrum Master, facilitated a look back at some of our experiences during our 18 months as the _Red Hat IT "DevOp Team"_.

We began the initial round of questions with what our individual perceptions of "DevOps" were before the team had formed. We followed that with what ended up being a **great** Q&A with the audience (thank you everyone who participated!). We ended the panel with our closing thoughts on what "DevOps" means to each of us now.

Here's a snippet from the official session description:


**Topics will include**






	
  * What we accomplished. We'll take you step-by-step through how we deliver our work using a combination of open source tools, including Docker.

	
  * How we rate both our cultural and tooling success.

	
  * Roadblocks, disruptions, and surprises we encountered and how we handled them.

	
  * How this project has changed the way we view our jobs and our work relationships.

	
  * What’s next for the team.

Between ourselves, we casually referred to this as our final team retrospective, an honest (and very public) look-back at lessons learned over the last year and a half.

And before I forget. So much thanks to [Andrew "Hoss" Butcher](https://twitter.com/akbutcher) [[GH](https://github.com/abutcher/)] for recording, editing, and posting the recording for us. I (**we**) owe you many [Tasty Beverages](http://dtr.tastybeverageco.com/) for that.
