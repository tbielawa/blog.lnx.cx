[![Creative Commons 4.0](https://blog.lnx.cx/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/4-0-400-300x225.png)](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/40768)I recently read the Creative Commons announcement, [CC’s Next Generation Licenses — Welcome Version 4.0!](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/40768). This made me think more about licensing in general, as it has been a topic receiving increased attention recently in Open Source/Tech communities. I think it's a very important subject that anyone involved in Open Source should have at least _some_ knowledge about.

Incorrectly or unlicensed software (or any other digital resource for that matter) can become a serious barrier to people attempting to reuse published works. I received my first exposure to the this when I was [contributing to the Ubuntu project](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/254839).

Since then I've become [quite](https://github.com/tbielawa/URLang/issues/1) a [proponent](https://github.com/tbielawa/py-prtstat/issues/3) of [making](https://github.com/tbielawa/jsonstats/issues/1) [sure](https://github.com/tbielawa/HamDecks/pull/1#issuecomment-24890330) [resources](https://github.com/Brofaces/rnoc/commit/a032526e8a99a21196b2c1be2e039fcbd8754f8f) [are](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/823) [properly](https://github.com/tbielawa/Virtual-Disk-Guide/commit/d6909946b534424aa645b9578e5c558561ac1972) [licensed](https://github.com/tbielawa/HamDecks/issues/2).

I was thrilled when [GitHub made it a priority](https://help.github.com/articles/open-source-licensing) to [encourage and facilitate](https://github.com/blog/1530-choosing-an-open-source-license) hosted projects having conspicuous and unambiguous licensing. They even made a site, [choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com/), to guide users through the process.
