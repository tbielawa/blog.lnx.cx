Shaggy and I drafted this guide to setting up your OpenGL development environment in Apple Xcode for cs470 (Introduction to Computer Graphics) at WVU.  It follows you through installing Xcode and including the relevant frameworks for creating a stock C++ OpenGL project.  Shaggy formatted it in DocBook and I think the result is pretty sexy.  Try it out for yourself!
