Documentation for [Setting up an OpenGL project using Apple Xcode](http://lnx.cx/docs/opengl-in-xcode/) has been updated for Xcode 4.2.5.

I got an email earlier this afternoon from someone seeking help on the topic and promptly updated it to go along with Xcode's new interface.  I've also added new sample code from a texture project I did at the university to help adequately test the set up.

Side note:  I was not aware how high the doc was on google search results!
