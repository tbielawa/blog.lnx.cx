My first blog post (co-authored wtih [Steve Milner](http://stevemilner.org/)) on the [Red Hat Developer Blog](http://developerblog.redhat.com/) ([@RHELDevelop](https://twitter.com/RHELdevelop)) has just been published!


**[Feeling Developer Pain](http://developerblog.redhat.com/2013/12/04/feeling-developer-pain/)**





<blockquote>[..] this post describes our journey from initially trying to implement a simple solution to improve the day-to-day lives of developers, through the technical limitations we experienced along the way, and finally arrives at the empathy for our developers we’ve gained from that experience. We’ll wrap up with a note on how Red Hat Software Collections ([announced as GA in September](http://developerblog.redhat.com/2013/09/12/rhscl1-ga/)) would’ve simplified our development process.</blockquote>


Enjoy!
