Just a heads up, at [Red Hat Summit](http://www.redhat.com/summit/) this year I'll be co-presenting a session with [Andy](http://blog.andyserver.com/) [Block](https://twitter.com/sabre1041). The presentation is onÂ **Wednesday, April 16** from **3:40 pm - 4:40 pm**.


# [JBoss In The Trenches](http://www.redhat.com/summit/sessions/#208)




In this session (my first time presenting at a conference! w00t!) we'll be going over the enormous year-long migration from JBoss EAP 4/5 to 6.1 we undertook last year in RH IT. As we move through the different stages of the migration we'll introduce you to industry best practices and implementation decisions to consider when deploying EAP6 clusters. Here's some teaser slides!
