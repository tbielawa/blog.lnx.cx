I've been working on my book, [The Linux Sysadmins Guide to Virtual Disks](http://lnx.cx/docs/vdg/output/Virtual-Disk-Operations.pdf), since my post about [long-term goals](http://blog.lnx.cx/2012/08/29/on-long-term-goals/) a few months back. I think it's about time I post some updates.



	
  * The PDF output has been substantially improved:

	
    * Fancy new fonts, free from Adobe ([Source Sans Pro](http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/08/source-sans-pro.html), [Source Code Pro](http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/09/source-code-pro.html))

	
    * Increased section depth numbering for ease of reference

	
    * Last built-on date/built-from commit information generated on each build in the introduction

	
    * Extra TOC's removed




	
  * New major-sections added:

	
    * **General disk drive information:** Components (with a full color diagram!), overview of drive access modes (CHS, LBA), history and misconceptions about disk drives, and details about the Master Boot Record

	
    * **Troubleshooting/FAQs**

	
    * **Colophon** with details about every part of the book: fonts used, text editor, XML processing tool-chain,...




	
  * New minor-sections added:

	
    * The **Cookbook** now has instructions for resizing RAW disk images

	
    * **Advanced Operations** now has a complete section on cloning physical disks (like thumb drives)




	
  * General improvements and corrections:

	
    * **Disk Concepts** "Formatting Partitions" has been overhauled completely. This is what inspired the new disk drive information major-section.

	
    * Spelling/Grammar errors corrected (many fewer than I anticipated!)

	
    * Informational tables now have a uniform look and feel

	
    * Introduction includes links to HTML/PDF format (based on your current format)
