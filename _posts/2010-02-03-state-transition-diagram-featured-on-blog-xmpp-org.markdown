The XMPP Client [State Transition Diagram](http://github.com/tbielawa/PAD-XMPP/blob/master/Graph/ConnectionStates.png) I created last December was featured on [xmpp.org](http://xmpp.org/2010/01/xmpp-roundup-13-articles-talks-and-events/).



<blockquote>Diagram for XMPP connection
One of the most difficult part when developping a new XMPP client is the connection mechanism workflow. Tim Bielawa has drawn a [state transitions diagram](http://github.com/tbielawa/PAD-XMPP/blob/master/Graph/ConnectionStates.png) that might be very helpful to thousands of developpers worldwide.</blockquote>



Now that's pretty exciting! I hope some one else may find it useful.
