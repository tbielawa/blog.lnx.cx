This is an **update** to my previous post about [my (then) upcoming conference presentation](https://blog.lnx.cx/2014/04/05/red-hat-summit-2014-jboss-in-the-trenches/).

The slides from my session at Red Hat Summit 2014, [**JBoss in the Trenches**](http://www.redhat.com/summit/sessions/#208), are now posted online. Most of the slides have generous amounts of extra material in their notes.



	
  * [JBoss_In_The_Trenches.pdf](http://people.redhat.com/~tbielawa/summit2014/JBoss_In_The_Trenches.pdf) - 2.57MiB

And as a bonus, here's a select few pictures from the trip to San Francisco:
